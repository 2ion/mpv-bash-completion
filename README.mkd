# mpv-bash-completion

A script for generating a Bash completion script for the popular [mpv
video player](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv).
It features...

* Completion for all --options,
* Type-based completion for --option arguments for choices, flags,
  integers and floats,
* Completion for upper/lower bounds for integer- and float-type argument
  ranges where applicable,
* Regular file name completion.

It does so by parsing the output of
```
mpv --list-options
```
directly and should thus work against all recent versions of mpv.

Included is support for generating a Debian package.

## Dependencies

* mpv (must be in $PATH)
* grep
* GNU core utilities
* make
* Bash 4

## Generating the Debian package

Build the package as explained in the Debian package maintainer manuals.

An easy method is to use my script
[git2deb](https://github.com/2ion/git2deb). Install all dependencies as
detailed in the README file and then simply run:

```
git2deb https://github.com/2ion/mpv-bash-completion.git debian
```

Obey the prompts. You'll find a readily-built Debian package in your
current working directory.

## Out-of-Tree downloads

Scripts for certain mpv versions and corresponding Debian packages are
available on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/2ion/mpv-bash-completion/downloads).

Please note that mpv is adding, removing or changing the options of its
command line interface quite frequently. For any new version of mpv
you're running, I recommend you rebuild the completion script to ensure
that it's still accurate.
